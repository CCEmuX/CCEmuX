## About Xtend
Most of you reading this probably haven't heard of [xtend](https://www.eclipse.org/xtend/) before. It's a language that compiles to Java, that adds lots of useful features such as extension methods, operator overloading, getters/setters, better type inference, and some syntactic sugar. If you look through the source code, it's easy enough to read it just knowing Java, but if you want to learn more about it check out the [documentation](https://www.eclipse.org/xtend/documentation/index.html)
